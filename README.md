# Reinforcement Learning

This is a repo containing explanations and implementations of the following Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Note that, if you want to see the notebooks clearly (with LaTeX and stuff) you need to clone the repo.  

* ```git clone git@github.com:ceteke/RL.git```  
* ```cd RL```
* ```jupyter notebook```  

## [Tabular](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/tree/master/Tabular)
The tabular methods are demonstrated on OpenAI Gym's FrozenLake environment.
### [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/tree/master/Tabular/Dynamic%20Programming)
* [Policy Iteration](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/blob/master/Tabular/Dynamic%20Programming/Policy%20Iteration.ipynb)
* [Value Iteration](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/blob/master/Tabular/Dynamic%20Programming/Value%20Iteration.ipynb)
### Monte Carlo
* On-Policy Control
* Exploring Starts
* Off-Policy Control
### [Temporal Difference](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/tree/master/Tabular/Temporal%20Difference)
* [On-Policy TD (Sarsa)](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/blob/master/Tabular/Temporal%20Difference/SARSA.ipynb)
* [Off-Policy TD (Q-Learning)](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/blob/master/Tabular/Temporal%20Difference/Q-Learning.ipynb)
## [Approximation](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/tree/master/Approximation)
* [Linear Sarsa](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/blob/master/Approximation/Linear%20Sarsa.ipynb)
* [Average Reward Linear Sarsa](https://github.com/ceteke/RL/blob/master/Approximation/Average%20Reward%20Semi-Gradient%20Sarsa.ipynb)
